            <p>Google's Vision statement is "to provide access to the world's information in one click."
            As you can see, Google's mission and vision statement both sound similar and are extremely concise in terms of their ultimate goal -- "to provide information." Unlike other platforms, Google remained extremely focused from the beginning on providing information to everyone with minimal effort</p>.

                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>Google's core mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. This mission, which has been in place since the company's early days, guides Google in its development of various products and services, with a focus on making information easily discoverable and valuable to users. 
                Here's a breakdown of how this mission translates into Google's work:
                Organizing Information:
                Google's search engine is the most prominent example of this, as it indexes and ranks vast amounts of information from the internet to help users find what they need.</p> 
                <p>Universal Accessibility:
                Google strives to make information accessible to everyone, regardless of language, location, or device. This includes providing tools and features to cater to diverse user needs and preferences. 
                Making Information Useful:
                Google aims to present information in a way that is not only accessible but also practical and beneficial for users, helping them learn, solve problems, and make informed decisions.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                 <p>Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California, USA.[23][24][25] The project initially involved an unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;[26][27] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.[28][29]</p>

            Google's homepage in 1998
            Google's original homepage had a simplistic design because the company founders had little experience in HTML, the markup language used for designing web pages[30]
            While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[31] They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.[32][31] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.[26] Page and Brin would also use their friend Susan Wojcicki's garage as their office when the search engine was set up in 1998.[33]</p>
